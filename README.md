## PlaylistHub

### Introduction

This app is a dynamic music community that offers a fresh and engaging experience every week. With the app, users can immerse themselves in the world of music curation and discovery. Every week, a new and exciting playlist subject is presented, sparking creativity and musical exploration. Users have the power to influence the playlist in two key ways: they can either curate it by selecting and adding up to 10 songs that fit the subject, or they can cast their votes for their favorite tracks submitted by others. After an active 5-day voting period, the app tallies the votes and officially closes the selection process at the end of the week. It then seamlessly generates the playlist on Spotify, bringing the community's musical choices to life. For an additional two days, the Spotify playlist link is made accessible on the app's website, allowing users to enjoy the collaborative masterpiece they've contributed to. As the new week begins, the website generates a fresh and intriguing subject, perpetuating the cycle of musical discovery and engagement, and inviting users to participate in the creation of another unique playlist. Join us in shaping the weekly soundscapes and sharing your musical passions with the world!
